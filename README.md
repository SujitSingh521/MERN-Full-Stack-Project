# MERN-Full-Stack-Project



Hello my friends 😃 welcome to the Full Stack MERN Blog Project Course! 🌐 Let's start an exciting journey together as we create a powerful and fully responsive MERN stack web app with cutting-edge features. Throughout this course, you'll become an expert in the latest version of React, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.

Source code and final version: https://github.com/SujitSingh521/MERN-Full-Stack-Project

🛠️ Our adventure kicks off with setting up React.js and Tailwind CSS, followed by navigating React Router Dom for dynamic pages. We'll dive deep into robust authentication using JSON Web Tokens and Google OAuth integration, all powered by Redux Toolkit for easy state management.

🔒 Secure both the client and backend for specific pages, like the admin dashboard. Admins gain the ability to effortlessly manage posts, comments, and users, complete with CRUD operations using the MongoDB database. The website is meticulously designed to be completely responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices. Plus, we've added a sleek dark mode to enhance user experience and cater to different preferences.

🔍 What sets this course apart is the addition of advanced search functionality. Users can search by title, limit results, and sort through a modern sidebar, utilizing cutting-edge search query techniques with MongoDB. Everyone has the ability to leave, edit, and delete their comments on the post pages, fostering an interactive community.

🚀 Finally, we'll deploy our fully functional MERN stack blog application for free using the 'render' platform, enabling you to share your creation and add it to your portfolio.

💻 All you need is a basic understanding of JavaScript and React to start this project. If you're as excited as we are, let's dive in and build this incredible project together! Subscribe, hit the bell, and join us on this coding adventure. 🚀✨
